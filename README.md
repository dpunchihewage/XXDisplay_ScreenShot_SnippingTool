# XXDisplay_ScreenShot_SnippingTool
This script is useful for automating the process of taking screenshots quickly and efficiently. However, it may need to be modified or customized for different screen resolutions or positions of the Snipping Tool buttons.
This is a Python script that automates the process of taking a screenshot using the Windows Snipping Tool. The script opens the Start menu, types "snip" to search for the Snipping Tool, and opens it by pressing Enter.
It then waits for the Snipping Tool to open and moves the mouse pointer to the "New" button, clicks it, and selects a region to capture by dragging the mouse cursor from the top-left to the bottom-right corners of the screen.
After capturing the screenshot, it moves the mouse pointer to the "close" button in the Snipping Tool, clicks it, and then moves the mouse pointer to the "No" button in the confirmation overlay and clicks it.
